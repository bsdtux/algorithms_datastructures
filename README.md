# algorithms_datastructures
This repo is designed to give me a reference of data structures and algorithms
to review. Each data structure or algorithm attempts to be written in different
ways if or when I can think of new ways to write them. Each data structure and 
algorithm also has a corresponding test to prove it out. 

## Run the tests
A makefile has been provided to easily run the tests. This is as simple as going 
to a terminal and typing

```bash
make unittest
```

This will test each module and report the missing coverage and if all tests pass.
